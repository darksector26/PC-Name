# PC Name
This small .net app lists PC information such as:

- PC Name
- Logged in User
- Model & Serial
- WiFi Name
- Signal Strength
- Last System Boot
- Free Disk Space
- IP Addresses

Currently we use this internally for remote tech support giving us some basic information without the user needing to know how to get it. 
I am not a programmer so the code in hear is probably messy but functional.
